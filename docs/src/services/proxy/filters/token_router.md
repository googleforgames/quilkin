# TokenRouter

The `TokenRouter` filter's job is to provide a mechanism to declare which Endpoints a packet should be sent to.

This Filter provides this functionality by comparing a byte array token found in the
[Filter Dynamic Metadata][filter-dynamic-metadata] from a previous Filter, and comparing it to
[Endpoint's tokens][endpoint-tokens], and sending packets to those Endpoints only if there is a match.

## Filter name
```text
quilkin.filters.token_router.v1alpha1.TokenRouter
```

## Configuration Examples
```rust
# let yaml = "
version: v1alpha1
filters:
  - name: quilkin.filters.token_router.v1alpha1.TokenRouter
    config:
        metadataKey: myapp.com/myownkey
clusters:
  - endpoints:
    - address: 127.0.0.1:26000
      metadata:
        quilkin.dev:
          tokens:
            - MXg3aWp5Ng== # Authentication is provided by these ids, and matched against
            - OGdqM3YyaQ== # the value stored in Filter dynamic metadata
    - address: 127.0.0.1:26001
      metadata:
        quilkin.dev:
          tokens:
            - bmt1eTcweA==
# ";
# let config = quilkin::config::Config::from_reader(yaml.as_bytes()).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(config.filters.load().len(), 1);
```

## Configuration Options ([Rust Doc](../../../../api/quilkin/filters/token_router/struct.Config.html))

```yaml
{{#include ../../../../../target/quilkin.filters.token_router.v1alpha1.yaml}}
```

## Metrics

* `quilkin_filter_TokenRouter_packets_dropped_total`
  A counter of the total number of packets that have been dropped. This is also provided with a `Reason` label, as there
  are differing reasons for packets to be dropped:
    * `NoEndpointMatch` - The token provided via the Filter dynamic metadata does not match any Endpoint's tokens.
    * `NoTokenFound` - No token has been found in the Filter dynamic metadata.
    * `InvalidToken` - The data found for the token in the Filter dynamic metadata is not of the correct data type
       (Vec<u8>)

## Sample Applications

### Packet Authentication

In combination with several other filters, the `TokenRouter` can be utilised as an authentication and access control
mechanism for all incoming packets.

Capturing the authentication token from an incoming packet can be implemented via the [CaptureByte](capture.md)
filter, with an example outlined below, or any other filter that populates the configured dynamic metadata key for the
authentication token to reside.

It is assumed that the endpoint tokens that are used for authentication are generated by an external system, are
appropriately cryptographically random and sent to each proxy securely.

For example, a configuration would look like:

```rust
# let yaml = "
version: v1alpha1
filters:
  - name: quilkin.filters.capture.v1alpha1.Capture # Capture and remove the authentication token
    config:
      suffix:
          size: 3
          remove: true
  - name: quilkin.filters.token_router.v1alpha1.TokenRouter
clusters:
  - endpoints:
    - address: 127.0.0.1:26000
      metadata:
        quilkin.dev:
          tokens:
            - MXg3aWp5Ng== # Authentication is provided by these ids, and matched against
            - OGdqM3YyaQ== # the value stored in Filter dynamic metadata
    - address: 127.0.0.1:26001
      metadata:
        quilkin.dev:
          tokens:
             - bmt1eTcweA==
# ";
# let config = quilkin::config::Config::from_reader(yaml.as_bytes()).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(config.filters.load().len(), 2);
```

On the game client side the [Concatenate](concatenate.md) filter could also be used to add authentication
tokens to outgoing packets.
