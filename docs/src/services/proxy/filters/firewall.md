# Firewall

The `Firewall` filter's job is to allow or block traffic depending on if the incoming traffic's IP and port matches
the rules set on the Firewall filter.

## Filter name
```text
quilkin.filters.firewall.v1alpha1.Firewall
```

## Configuration Examples
```rust
# let yaml = "
version: v1alpha1
filters:
  - name: quilkin.filters.firewall.v1alpha1.Firewall
    config:
      on_read:
        - action: ALLOW
          sources:
            - 192.168.51.0/24
          ports:
            - 10
            - 1000-7000
      on_write:
        - action: DENY
          sources:
            - 192.168.51.0/24
          ports:
            - 7000
clusters:
  - endpoints:
      - address: 127.0.0.1:7001
# ";
# let config = quilkin::config::Config::from_reader(yaml.as_bytes()).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(config.filters.load().len(), 1);
```

## Configuration Options ([Rust Doc](../../../../api/quilkin/filters/firewall/struct.Config.html))

```yaml
{{#include ../../../../../target/quilkin.filters.firewall.v1alpha1.yaml}}
```

### Rule Evaluation

The Firewall filter supports DENY and ALLOW actions for access control. When multiple DENY and ALLOW actions are used
for a workload at the same time, the evaluation is processed in the order it is configured, with the first matching
rule deciding if the request is allowed or denied:

1. If a rule action is ALLOW, and it matches the request, then the entire request is allowed.
2. If a rule action is DENY and it matches the request, then the entire request is denied.
3. If none of the configured rules match, then the request is denied.
